two player game:

1. enter our names and have them displayed

2. have our order chosen for us by the game

3.take turns placing our marks in empty spaces

4.not be able to place our marks in an occupied space

5.be told when a move causes a player to win, or to draw

6.start the game over without having to reset the browser

one player:
see the name 'Computer' displayed as my opponent

have the Computer player make moves as if it were a human player with the correct mark in an empty space -->

<!-- 
As a user playing a single player game I would be delighted to:

have the Computer make 'better-than-guessing' choices when placing a mark on the board

set the board size myself ("wider" or "taller" than 3x3) -->
